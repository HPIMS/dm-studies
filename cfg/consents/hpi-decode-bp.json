However, the standard way to measure this condition is still quite cumbersome and requires a cuff-based device (you have likely experienced this cuff to measure blood pressure at the doctor's office). With the surge of more comfortable wearables like smartwatches and armbands, blood pressure monitoring at home is becoming easier and can thus have the potential, to help prevent and monitor not only hypertension but also many other cardiovascular health risks. In this study, we will test wearable devices to see how they measure blood pressure compared to a medical-grade oscillometric device. At home monitoring of blood pressure (BP) could lead to better health outcomes, but we do not know how accurate some of these measurements are."
