The main goal of this study is to use information provided by participants so that we can better understand how pain, stress, and sleep symptoms work together to affect your daily life. If you choose to join the study, we will combine your health information with wearable device data (e.g. Fitbit or Apple Watch, if available) to track symptoms and health outcomes. The study is called the eHive study because we are creating a digital understanding of your health."

In doing so, you will be allowing their collection of some personal information like your name, email address, GPS coordinates and other technology specific data. The Apple Watch (as well as other devices like a Fitbit, if you sync it up with the study app) will measure physiological parameters (such as heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, temperature, and movement) and sleep related parameters (such as time in each sleep stage, time in bed, and # of wake ups a night).

These companies could use the data that they collect to make money. This does not include health information, which is protected by this research study. There are data specific to the company’s terms and conditions which Apple and/or Fitbit has set up with you upon download and participation in the study application (or any application that you choose to download to your phone).
