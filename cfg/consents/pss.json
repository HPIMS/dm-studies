The main goal of this study is to use information provided by participants so that we can better understand how pain, stress, and sleep symptoms work together to affect your daily life. If you choose to join the study, we will combine your health information with wearable device data (e.g. Fitbit or Apple Watch, if available) to track symptoms and health outcomes. The study is called the eHive study because we are creating a digital understanding of your health."
