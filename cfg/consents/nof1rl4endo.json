These symptoms are mild in nature and subside after a day (or a few days in the case of post-exercise musclesoreness). To mitigate any serious risks, we take several precautions. 1) During eligibility screening, we will use the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ) to identify any risks. This is the commonly used physical activity eligibility screener to identify those who might pose risks to engaging in exercise. 2) Next, upon enrollment, you will have a brief orientation with our research coordinator. This orientation will include information on how to engage in exercise safely without overexertion, how to monitor heart rate, perceived exercise intensity, and types of physical activities (e.g., aerobic, strength, stretching). 3) We will also ask you about types of exercises you are comfortable with, and preferences. This information will be used for generating the exercise recommendations for you during the study. 4) We will monitor all exercise recommendations and any negative responses and evaluate with clinical experts to ensure continued safety and plausibility of the recommendations. 5) You will have the opportunity to provide feedback via ehive on the exercise recommendation. You also have the freedom to opt out of an exercise recommendation if you are feeling unwell or for another reason. In these instances, we ask that you track these and provide feedback within the ehive App. We will use these communications as additional information while monitoring the recommendations to refine them as needed and ensure your safety.
