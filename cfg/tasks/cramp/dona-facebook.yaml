      "Having tight social bonds and a network of people that support you through hard times can be a very big help. The secondary aim of the CRAMP Study is to investigate if social interactions mediate the relationship between resilience and menstrual cramps. Using our data donation platform you will share Facebook Messanger and WhatsApp data in a completely de-identified way. We will never be able to read the content of your messages or any information regarding whom you interacted with. However, we will be able to assess some measures of your social interactions, such as the amount of messages you sent per day. This will help us understand if social interactions can improve the wellbeing of menstruating women."
