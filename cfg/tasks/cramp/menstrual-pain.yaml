      "The CRAMP study is all about menstrual pain. We will ask you questions regarding your menstrual pain throughout the study. But we can’t make sure that what you will report during the study will be what your usual experience is. We therefore designed this survey to collect information regarding your usual experience with menstrual pain. We don’t only want to know how intense the pain is, but also how you experience the pain. We will therefore include two sets of questions, one regarding your thoughts and feelings during pain, and the other one regarding how your daily activities are affected by your pain. Answering these questions is important to help us characterize pain beyond a mere score on a piece of paper and unravel its complexity."
