We will ask you several questions regarding your general health. We will also ask you to share your Apple Health app data with us. This will enable us to account for pre-existing health conditions in our analyses. Doing so will ensure that we can look at menstrual cramps-specific processes rather than other disorders that might influence your cramps."
