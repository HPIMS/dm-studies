      "In the CRAMP Study, we want to closely characterize the relationship between stress, resilience and menstrual cramps and symptoms. Since stress and pain usually come and go, it is of uttermost importance that we assess how they change not only day by day, but also during the day. Ultimately, this will enable us to look for temporal patterns of pain, stress and their relationship and unlock these complex interactions. We therefore ask you to complete this brief daily survey to tell us how your day was. "
