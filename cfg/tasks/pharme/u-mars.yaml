  title: App Rating
  description: >-
    If not done so yet, please use the app thoroughly for at least 10 minutes to
    determine how easy it is to use, how well it functions and does it do what
    it purports to do. Also review app settings, developer information, external
    links, security features, etc.


    In the survey, please select the answer that most accurately represents the
    quality of the app you are rating. All items are rated on a 5-point scale
    from “1 Inadequate” to “5 Excellent”. Select N/A if the app component is
    irrelevant.
