name: PGx App Validation Study

shortDescription: >-
  Patient Comprehension of Pharmacogenetic (PGx) Test Results Delivered by a
  Mobile Application vs. Pharmacist-Led Counseling.

longDescription: >-
  A pharmacogenetic test investigates how your genes affect your response to
  medications. It determines whether a medication could be an effective
  treatment or whether it may cause side effects. In this research study, we are
  testing a mobile app, PharMe, to share PGx results.


  The main goal of the study is to compare patients' understanding of their
  pharmacogenetic (PGx) test results shared through a mobile app vs.
  pharmacist-led counseling.
