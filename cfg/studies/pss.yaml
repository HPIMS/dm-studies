name: "DDP: Pain, Stress, Sleep Study"
description: The Digital Discovery Program at the Hasso Plattner Institute for
  Digital Health at Mount Sinai is focused on understanding how digital
  technology can be used to increase our understanding of complex disease. In
  this study, we aim to use wearable devices to learn about underlying symptoms
  related to pain, stress, and sleep, which affect us all every day. By
  providing lifestyle data, you can gain insight into your own health and
  behaviors, lead a healthier life, all while contributing to important
  scientific research.
