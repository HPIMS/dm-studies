name: VR Study for Sleep and Binge Eating

shortDescription: This research study examines the effect of sleep quality on eating behavior in people who suffer from Binge Eating Disorder.

longDescription: Circadian rhythm is your bodyâ€™s internal clock, mostly driven by light and darkness. It helps you know when to feel tired and when to feel awake. Sometimes things like food intake, stress, and physical activity can affect our rhythm. When this happens our sleep quality lessens and, in turn, could affect eating behavior, increasing appetite and cravings. In this study, we will use circadian rhythm technology (CRT) on a VR headset to improve sleep quality over the course of 4 weeks. Procedures include an MRI scan, questions about your eating/sleep patterns and surveys at the beginning of the study and 1-month later.
