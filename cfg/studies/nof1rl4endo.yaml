  This study aims to evaluate the association of daily pain symptoms to varying
  exercise recommendations among individuals with chronic pelvic pain disorders.

  
  Participation in the study involves following tailored exercise
  recommendations 3 times a week for 10 weeks in total, wearing an activity
  tracker, and tracking daily pain and other health symptoms, physical function
  and quality of life, as well as feedback on the exercise recommendations. The
  data will be used to personalize the recommendations every week. The results
  from the study will allow us to better understand what types of activities
  might be optimal for pain management in pelvic pain disorders.

You can choose not to participate in the interview and still enroll in this study. If you agree to the interview, the study team will set-up a virtual call with the lead researcher, Dr. Ensari. During the call, the ehive app will be described to you and you will be guided through its different components. Next, you will be asked to complete simple tasks on the app such as tracking a symptom and entering medications. The tasks will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. You will then be asked to complete 2 brief questionnaires on the ehive app and answer open- ended questions to share your perceptions and feedback. The session will be audio recorded for analysis. Do you agree to participate in the optional user feedback interview?",
