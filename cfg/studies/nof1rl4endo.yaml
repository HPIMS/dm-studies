  This study aims to evaluate the association of daily pain symptoms to varying
  exercise recommendations among individuals with chronic pelvic pain disorders.

  
  Participation in the study involves following tailored exercise
  recommendations 3 times a week for 10 weeks in total, wearing an activity
  tracker, and tracking daily pain and other health symptoms, physical function
  and quality of life, as well as feedback on the exercise recommendations. The
  data will be used to personalize the recommendations every week. The results
  from the study will allow us to better understand what types of activities
  might be optimal for pain management in pelvic pain disorders.
