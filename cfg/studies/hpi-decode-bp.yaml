name: "Decode BP"

shortDescription:
  The goal of the Decode BP study is to understand if data derived
  from optical sensors in wearable devices can be used to track blood pressure.
longDescription: The Decode BP study aims to understand if data derived
  from optical sensors in wearable devices can be used to track blood pressure.

  Two wearables will be used and compared to a medical-grade blood pressure monitor.
  We hope to better understand the relationship between the data from the sensors and the
  standard blood pressure monitor.
