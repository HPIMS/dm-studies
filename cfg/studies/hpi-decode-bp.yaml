name: "Decode BP"
description: The main goal of the Decode BP study is to understand if data derived from optical sensors in wearable devices can be used to track blood pressure. Two wearables (Empatica E4 and Polar Verity) will be used and compared to a medical-grade blood pressure monitor (Withings BPM Connect). We will collect data from these two wearables while simultaneously measuring your blood pressure 2 times a day for one week. We hope to better understand the relationship between the data from the optical sensors to the standard blood pressure monitor.
